INTRODUCTION: This project analyzes three datasets from Los Angeles County: employee demographics, schools and universities, and parks and open spaces.. The goal is to explore trends in workforce diversity, education access, and the distribution of recreational spaces. These insights will help improve public services and ensure equitable resource distribution.data set link: https://data.lacounty.gov/datasets/bb365027d03747eb8744bcb9fc4ee34a_0/explore?showTable=true                                                                                                                             
DATA SET AND WHAT IT INCLUDES:  The data used in this analysis was downloaded from various public sources related to Los Angeles County. The employee demographics dataset provided insights into workforce diversity, while the educational institutions dataset highlighted access to schools. Additionally, the parks dataset examined the distribution and quality of recreational facilities. Some new variables were created to enhance insights. Additionally, data types had to be adjusted, particularly for date and categorical fields, to ensure compatibility with the analysis tools.
FUTURE WORK: Building on these analyses, future work could involve integrating additional datasets, such as socioeconomic and census data, to examine relationships between income levels, housing, and access to resources. Longitudinal analysis could highlight changes in workforce, education, and park usage over time, while geospatial analysis would visually map resource allocation, revealing areas that may need targeted improvement. These future directions will provide a more comprehensive perspective on public resources across Los Angeles County.
